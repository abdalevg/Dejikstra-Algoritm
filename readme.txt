The application is meant to find the shortest ways in graph using Dijkstra algorithm.

1.Choose file "pre made graph" by using Open_Graph button.

2.Choose a row and press Start Point button to set start point.

3.Then choose another row and press Point button to set destination point.

4.By using Find_Ways button you will get the shortest path from a start point to a destination point.

5.To reset point use Change_Points button.

6.You can also create your own graph by using Set_Size and Set_Graph buttons.

7.You can save your graph with Save_Graph button.
